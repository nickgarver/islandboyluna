<div class="grid-box-text bio">
  hi! my name is luna and i am from this beautiful place called Ohio.
  creating music is my release for the constant overload of feeling and
  emotion in my life, and without it, i honestly think i would be lost.
  i find the most amazing feeling blossoms inside of you when getting lost
  in a song you are creating; you don't really think consciously about what
  you are making, but rather the music just reflects your current state of
  mind. just a regular human makin' tunes while exploring this crazy planet.
  my insta is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/islandboyluna">@islandboyluna</a>, i post pretty often there!â€¨
  <br>
  <br>
  much love,
  <br>
  luna.
